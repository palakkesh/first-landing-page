                    Advertising keeps Royalti Real Estate Private Limited and many of the websites and services you use
                    free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as
                    possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Third party advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are not

                    online services to make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is known as
                    interest-based advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from
                    continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers. Without
                    cookies, it's really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were
                    shown and how many clicks they received.
